            I've recently become fascinated with <a
                href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-generative-art-what-it-is-and-how-you-make-it-b0b363b50a70/">generative
                art</a> -- that is, making art with code. Below
            are some
            the pieces that I've made as I explore this new facet of code. </p>
        <p>
            These were all made solely throught Javascript, thanks to incredibly user-friendly <a
                href='https://p5js.org/'>p5.js library</a>.

    <!-- ==== SOLAR SYSTEM ==== -->

            <h3>Solar System Model</h3>
            <p>
                This project was a great tutorial in Javascript classes, a concept that I had previously had no
                experience with. Each
                object in the solar system here belongs to a Planet class. The Planet class functions as a template that
                allows me to
                quickly create a variety of celestial bodies, just by changing their size, distance, and orbital speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I intend to use this code to eventually build an interactive solar system designer, where users can
                create their own
                start systems (loosley) based on real orbital mechanics.

            <h3>Fractal Tree 1</h3>
            <p>
                The initial prototype for this project used recursion, but I followed <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcdNSZ9IzJM">this tutorial</a> to use Javascript
                classes instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using classes in this way gave me more control over animating the tree's growth and appearance.

                <h3>Tiles</h3>
                <p>
                    One common technique found in generative art is the use of tiles. A programmer can divvy the canvas
                    into a rows of
                    tiles, each of which be manipulated independently. Tiling can lead to all kinds of trippy designs
                    and patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the design above, I programmed each tile to contain a series of squares. The rotation of the
                    squares within the tiles
                    is tied to the x and y axis of the tile's position, which causes the tiles to gradually become more
                    and more distorted
                    each time they are drawn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the design to the left, the program randomly determines what shape to draw in each tile. Each
                    tile has a 70% chance
                    to draw a series of squares, and a 30% chance to draw circles instead. The coloration of each shape
                    is determined by its
                    position relative to the rest of the canvas.

    <!-- ==== PHYLLOTAXIS ==== -->
    <section class='phyllotaxis inlineSketch'>
        <div class='phylloDesc desc'>
            <h3>Phyllotaxis</h3>
            <p>
                This piece was made following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoJgHFYWxY&t=1s">excellent
                    tutorial</a>, with a few variations that I added.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program uses a mathematical formula found in nature to create this spiral pattern, known as
                <i>phyllotaxis</i>.
                Phyllotaxis can be seen in sunflower petals, in the leaves of succulents, and so on.

        <div class='phyllotilesDesc desc'>
            <h3>Phyllotiles</h3>
            <p>
                Here I combine the two techniques above to further show off the diversity of the phyllotaxis formula.
                Each spiral is
                drawn with the same code, but an element of randomness slightly changes the phyllotaxis formula. Simply
                changing the
                angle at which the spirals are drawn by a fraction of a degree will create wildly different patterns.
